## Open2 Getting Started
* After forking the repository you will need to run `bower install` in the client folder and `npm install` in the server folder.
* The database `db.js` file in the server folder will not run because it is 'requires' a `dbconfig.js` file which lists our credentials for the app.
 * The `dbconfig.js` file contains the host, user, password,  and database within an object which is referenced within `db.js`

##Issue Tracking
Github has a built in issue tracking system that's pretty awesome! You can tag issues, assign someone to them, mark them as part of a milestone, etcetera. If you haven't used them before, check out [Github's writeup on them](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). We followed Github's reccomendations, along with a [tagging style guide](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/).
